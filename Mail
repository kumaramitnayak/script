ChatGPT Subject: Zabbix Phase 2 Activity Plans and Implementation Availability  Dear DB Team,  I hope this email finds you well. Following our recent discussion regarding the Zabbix Phase 2 activity plans, I would like to summarize the proposed approach and kindly inquire about your availability to implement the necessary changes. Please review the two plans below and provide your feedback and confirmation on your team's ability to execute them.  Plan A: As discussed, during the Zabbix 6.0 upgrade, the new Zabbix staging web and app will be pointed to the master node, and the other two nodes will be shut down and kept out of sync. If everything proceeds smoothly, we will then redirect Zabbix to Proxy SQL, and it will be your team's responsibility to sync the other two nodes with the master.  Plan B: In the event of any failure, we have a contingency plan. Your team will make one of the shut down nodes the new master, and our Zabbix team will point the old web and app to this newly selected master node. Subsequently, your team will rebuild the failed database and ensure it remains in sync with the other two nodes.  To proceed with these plans, we kindly request the following information from your team:  Confirmation of your availability to implement the proposed changes. Estimated timeline for completing the required tasks. Any potential risks or concerns you foresee during the implementation process. Any additional resources or support you may require from our team to ensure a successful implementation. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated to allow us to move forward with the necessary preparations for the upcoming Zabbix Phase 2 activity. Should you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.  Thank you for your cooperation and support.
